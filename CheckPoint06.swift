/*
create a struct to store information about a car, including its model, number of seats, and current gear, then add a 
method to change gears up or down. Have a think about variables and access control: what data should be a variable 
rather than a constant, and what data should be exposed publicly? Should the gear-changing method validate its input 
somehow?
