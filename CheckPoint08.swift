/*
Your challenge is this: make a protocol that describes a building, adding various properties and 
  methods, then create two structs, House and Office, that conform to it. Your protocol should require 
  the following:

    A property storing how many rooms it has.
    A property storing the cost as an integer (e.g. 500,000 for a building costing $500,000.)
    A property storing the name of the estate agent responsible for selling the building.
    A method for printing the sales summary of the building, describing what it is along with its 
      other properties.

    var rooms: Int {get set}
    var cost: Int {get set}

    func printSalesSummary(){
        print("Rooms: \(rooms) Cost: Â£\(cost) Agent: \(realEstateAgent)")
    }
}

struct House: Building {
    var rooms: Int
    var cost: Int
    var realEstateAgent: String
    var occupants: Int

struct Office: Building {
    var rooms: Int
    var cost: Int
    var realEstateAgent: String
    var floorArea: Int
}

var myOffice = Office(rooms: 5, cost:500_000, realEstateAgent: "Bloggs", floorArea: 500)
var myHouse = House(rooms: 2, cost:200_000, realEstateAgent: "Fletchers", occupants: 1)

myOffice.printSalesSummary()
myHouse.printSalesSummary()
